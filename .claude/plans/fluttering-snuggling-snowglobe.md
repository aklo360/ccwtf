# Plan: Character Prompt - Lesson Learned

## Summary
No changes needed - user already fixed the prompt.

## What I Got Wrong
I incorrectly described the $CC mascot anatomy as having only ONE protrusion on the left side ("ear").

## Correct Anatomy (from user's fix)
- **2 ARMS**: One rectangular arm on LEFT side, one on RIGHT side (symmetrical)
- **4 LEGS**: At the bottom (2 left, 2 right, gap in middle)
- **TOP**: Completely flat - NO protrusions
- **FACE**: Two empty rectangular holes (no real eyes, no mouth)

## The Fixed Prompt
The user has already corrected `/Users/aklo/dev/ccwtf/app/api/generate/route.ts` with the proper description. No further changes needed.

## Verification
Test the meme generator at `/meme` - the character should now have:
- Flat top (no antenna)
- Two symmetrical arms (left and right)
- Four legs at bottom
- No extra protrusions
